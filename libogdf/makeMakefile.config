[COIN]

#* Select your solver for COIN
#* CPLEX:
# solver_name = COIN_OSI_CPX
# solver_incl = /somewhere/ILOG/cplex90/include/ilcplex
#* Coin's CLP:
# solver_name =  COIN_OSI_CLP
# solver_incl = 
#* Coin's Symphony
# solver_name =  COIN_OSI_SYM
# solver_incl = /home/plug/COIN/SYMPHONY/include

#* For compilation of a executable program, you have to link against the corresponding libraries.
#* Use parameters like:
#*   for COIN itself: "-L/somewhere/COIN/lib -lCoinUtils -lOsi"
#*   for CPLEX:       "-L/somewhere/CPLEX/bin/i86_linux2_glibc2.3_gcc3.2 -lcplex90 -lOsiCpx"
#*   for CLP:         "-L/home/plug/COIN/lib -lOsiClp -lClp"
#*   for Symphony:    "-L/comewhere/COIN/SYMPHONY/lib -lsym -lOsiSym"
#*
#* ATTENTION: When compiling your executable, you have to set the compiler-flags just as 
#*            you did for OGDF
